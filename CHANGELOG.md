# Changelog

## 0.5.0

- A mode button on the left of full screen: it shows the mode in use (a monitor for desktop, a tablet in the accent
  colour for tablet) and switches it. It is not saved; a posture change makes the app decide again.
- The real-input tests are cut from twenty scripts and about a hundred app starts to two scripts and four starts
  (about half a minute): they now prove only what unit tests cannot see. The checks were shown to catch a broken
  mouse mode and a broken mode button.

## 0.4.0

- A delete-page button (a bin) on the left of the + button. It deletes the page being looked at, at once, with no
  question asked; the ink on it goes with it, the later pages move up with theirs, links are carried along, and
  the file loses the page when saved. The last page there is stays (the button is dimmed). It cannot be undone,
  and it drops the undo history, which may refer to the page.
- Build output, packages and test scratch files default to folders beside the repository, not in it.
- The portable build script no longer leaves its build settings behind in the shell.

## 0.3.0

- Desktop and tablet modes, chosen from the machine's posture (`SM_CONVERTIBLESLATEMODE`, guarded so that an
  ordinary desktop PC, which reports "slate", stays a desktop) and re-checked when Windows announces a
  posture change. `--mode desktop|tablet|auto` overrides it.
- Desktop: the mouse stands in for a stylus on the pen, shape and pointer tools (left draws, right erases,
  middle lassos); Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y, Ctrl+Shift+Z and Ctrl+S.
- Tablet: the stylus places, edits and moves text with the text tool; the mouse only scrolls.
- The window losing focus now ends a mouse gesture instead of leaving it half done.

## 0.2.0

- The application layer was rewritten around a `Tool` trait: Pen, Shape, Text and Pointer are separate
  objects that own their gestures and paint their own overlays; the device rules are data
  (`Tool::policy`); the window's asks of the shell are a request queue. See `apps/inkpdf/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- A layering test and a tool contract suite guard the structure.
- Long strokes cost the same per frame however long they get (the live curve is extended incrementally),
  and a frame carrying new pen samples no longer waits for tile uploads.
- Standalone portable build (`installer/build-portable.ps1`) with settings kept beside the exe.
- Behaviour is otherwise unchanged from 0.1.11.

## 0.1.x

- 0.1.11: input rules per tool (the text tool is keyboard and mouse only; the stylus does nothing to the page
  with it); line and curve tools drawn by tapping.
- 0.1.10: shapes reworked into kinds with the anchors that suit them (lines and polygons, splines,
  rectangles, ellipses, axes); straight segments stay straight.
- 0.1.8-0.1.9: text tool (typed text saved as Free Text), wrapping at the page edge.
- 0.1.5-0.1.7: shape tool and editable anchors, per-tool settings, page insertion.
- 0.1.0-0.1.4: blank page start, links, swipe-up to add a page, in-app save prompt, Explorer thumbnails,
  pen panel, pointer tool.
